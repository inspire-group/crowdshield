0;@MELANIATRUMP  don't you worry about what anybody has to say, you did a great job and you spoke from the heart. Don't ever stop doing that.
1;@MELANIATRUMP  imma let you finish, but  @FLOTUS  had one of the greatest speeches of all time
1;@MELANIATRUMP  Donald Speech: My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.  #Original
0;@MELANIATRUMP  Exactly right! Ignore the media and move forward. You'll be a great First Lady!
1;@MELANIATRUMP  *copy, paste* OKAY speech is written! Let's go!
1;@MELANIATRUMP  you barely know how to speak English so how did you come up with that speech all by yourself?
1;@MELANIATRUMP  Oh look, a white republican stealing intellectual property from black people without giving credit. Shocker, there.
0;@MELANIATRUMP    @realDonaldTrump   You have more integrity in one of your strands of hair than Hillary has in her whole body.  Love you both !
0;@MELANIATRUMP  Great Job tonight at  #gopconvention . Can't wait until you move in to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue!
1;@MELANIATRUMP  Someone needs to take responsibility for this clear  #plagarism

1;@MELANIATRUMP  speech is yet another example of racial appropriation by whites: come up with your own speech instead of swiping from  @FLOTUS
1;@MELANIATRUMP  please never return to Slovenia   we don't want you & your grandpa Donald here
