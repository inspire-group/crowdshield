0;@MELANIATRUMP   You are beautiful & graceful.  Your RNC speech was heartfelt. I loved it. Some persons are envious of you, ignore them.
0;@MELANIATRUMP  Everything A Real American Wife Mother & Citizen strives to be. All  @MichelleObama  has never been.  https://twitter.com/annieb0823/status/755371877380521984  …
0;@MELANIATRUMP   You did an outstanding job w/ your speech from your   . Our next #FLOTUS    #RNCinCLE
0;@MELANIATRUMP  The liberal left discounts 16 minutes of her speech and use 1 minute sound bit to discredit her. Melania's speech was great!
0;@MELANIATRUMP  Wow, your speech was moving & inspiring!  You are a class act & I am proud to call you the next FLOTUS. Thank you for hope!
1;@MELANIATRUMP  stole her speech from  @FLOTUS , and  @realDonaldTrump  stole his whole personality from Scrooge McDuck. They make a good couple.
1;@MELANIATRUMP  so since  #MichelleObama  speech worked for her YOU stole it?  #plagiarism   #RNCinCLE   #nobrain   #youarenofirstlady   #cantwrite
0;@MELANIATRUMP  for President 2020. I mean I know she can't run constitutionally but dang, what a speech and what a story!  #Class
1;@MELANIATRUMP  can't even come up with her own words at  #RNCConvention  ,lifted 80% from First Lady Michelle's '08 speech  #Classy
0;@MELANIATRUMP  You were beautiful and wonderful!!!!  #FutureFlotus   #ImWithYou   #TrumpPence16
1;@MELANIATRUMP  ohhh poor Melania- you posed for the pictures so deal with it
0;@MELANIATRUMP  Great job tonight you will make a great First Lady.Talkmore about  how you will help our children and our precious women.
1;@MELANIATRUMP  did you just google "first lady convention speech", then roll with it?  #FamousMelaniaTrumpQuotes
1;@MELANIATRUMP  's speech at the  #RNCinCLE   was a total joke. I literally had an actual laugh out loud.  #MichelleSaidItBest   #SecondPlaceSpeech
1;@MELANIATRUMP  my mom came to this country and taught me hard work makes anything true but since she's a mexican I guess it doesn't compare
0;@MELANIATRUMP  In my opinion, YOU are an inspiring woman...the only woman I want to see in our White House.
1;@MELANIATRUMP  may I suggest you something for your next speech ? "I have a dream".
0;@MELANIATRUMP  gave a beautiful articulate LONG speech last night, I hate that it's being overshadowed by ONE PART  #MilaniaRocks   #MAGA
0;@MELANIATRUMP  did a fine job at the RNC last night. Her speech writer however, needs to be fired for putting her in a precarious position.
1;@MELANIATRUMP  is shameful, they should of kept her dumbass quiet as a mouse https://twitter.com/hawaiidelilah/status/755267293236588544  …
1;@MELANIATRUMP  How is it that we heard exactly what you said  in 2008 by the one only Mrs  @MichelleObama
0;@MELANIATRUMP  You have more class in ur pinky than that Obama woman will ever have.Also,know attention is paid to what "THEY"say.
0;@MELANIATRUMP  You were perfect last night. It's a positive thing what is happening. You have struck fear in the left, & they're on the run
0;@MELANIATRUMP  Your one "Classy Lady" Melania!!! Loved your speech! It was Amazing.... Haters are gonna Hate!!!  #StayClassy
1;@MELANIATRUMP   Your  #clueless  or a  #fraud  where is  @realDonaldTrump  to defend u? Something else to be proud of from a great husband  #losers
0;@MELANIATRUMP   #TrumpWarriors  have your back   #Trump2016    #RNCinCLE   #TrumpTrain    #TeamTrump   #MelaniaTrump  CLASS ACT  https://twitter.com/mygianluca/status/755451967644770309  …
1;@MELANIATRUMP  ooooops!  "you're fired!"  you can fool some of the people, some of the time, but...copying only works in China
0;@MELANIATRUMP  did an excellent job tonight. Proud to be an American. Proud to be a Republican.  #RNCinCLE   #GOPConvention
0;@MELANIATRUMP  Hang in there. America is with you.  Don't fall into media trap and Cruz taunting. You are above that and showed it at RNC.
1;@MELANIATRUMP 's Two-Lies-Combo: Yes. I graduated.  No. I didn't plagiarize
1;@MELANIATRUMP  Melania's team of writers took notes on past speakers at conventions obviously. pic.twitter.com/eAzMD3YBNG
0;@MELANIATRUMP  That was one well delivered beautiful speech you gave last night Melania. You and Donald are going to be great for our country
1;@MELANIATRUMP 's speech must have been written by a Trump University graduate.  #RNCinCLE
1;@MELANIATRUMP    Once a slattern...Not a single, uplifting, noble thought. She "wrote it herself..." WHAT A LIAR.https://twitter.com/jarretthill/status/755242423991709697  …
1;@MELANIATRUMP  just reminds me of that one kid in school that copied someones exam and copied their name too..!!!    #CopyAndPaste
1;@MELANIATRUMP  question so if you don't get in trouble for plagiarism why should I right?    I mean it's just a few "notes"
0;@MELANIATRUMP  America loves you.  You will be a  great 1st lady! https://twitter.com/MulcahyA/status/755484536365060096  …
1;@MELANIATRUMP   #MelaniaTrumpSpeech  one word ...Plagiarism
0;@MELANIATRUMP  had an amazing speech. Her words and phrases could be traced back to LITERALLY ANYTHING. To say it's stolen is ridiculous.
1;@MELANIATRUMP  your husband is a billionaire, buy a thesaurus
1;@MELANIATRUMP  lmfao seriously ? You had to plagiarize  @MichelleObama 's speech ? WHAT A JOKE JUST LIKE YOUR HUSBAND IS !
1;@MELANIATRUMP  how does it feel to be completely irrelevant in every way possible???
1;@MELANIATRUMP  looks especially bad because you plagiarized the paragraphs about honesty and hard work.  #epicfail
1;@MELANIATRUMP  haha so dummy! Serious now no one will take your seriously!
0;@MELANIATRUMP  knocked it out of the park tonight, so proud to call her First Lady of the USA...Mr.President  @realDonaldTrump   #ImWithYou
0;@MELANIATRUMP   @GenFlynn  Excellent Speeches!  @rudygiulianiGOP  You Gave Them He||  @realDonaldTrump  Spectacular intro 4 our next 1st Lady
1;@MELANIATRUMP  humiliated herself the second she said "I do" to that poor, VERY poor excuse of a wanna be man! Weak man at that! VERY WEAK!
1;@MELANIATRUMP  stole most of her speech from  @MichelleObama  btw.
1;@MELANIATRUMP   good luck with your life you couldn't even write your own speech..... At least I'm going to college.....
1;@MELANIATRUMP . NoTrump porn   in the peoples house not conservative not a good roll model for young woman Go home no Sodom & Gomorrah in USA
