1;@Kaepernick7  refusal to stand 4 national anthem is what I would expect from a jock...with nothing but air between his ears  @NFL

1;@Kaepernick7  only in America can you be raised by whites, make millions and still be pissed at whites!

0;@Kaepernick7  has my support, I think people are really getting upset with what he did, instead of empathizing with the message he deliver.
0;@Kaepernick7  you took alot of heat for sitting during the american anthem i don't blame you stand up for your people BLACK LIVES MATTER!!!!!
0;@Kaepernick7  is certainly one of the  #entitled , but I will fight to the death to allow him to sit.  #FirstAmendment   #Constitution

1;@Kaepernick7   @DailyCaller  Great role model! Would you be where you are today, if you were living anywhere but the USA? No you wouldn't!
0;@Kaepernick7  respecting our flag and country doesn't automatically mean supporting the corrupt politicians. Work together to change that.
1;@Kaepernick7  are you half oppressed only the white part of you makes the 19mil well I hope you chokes on that 19 mil you poor little child
1;@Kaepernick7  Colin nothing like putting gas on the fire!!! Another ignorant BLM follower!!! Go help people out in Chicago then!!!
0;@Kaepernick7  has the right to make issues known, however, the way he went about the whole situation was completely wrong, sets a bad example
1;@Kaepernick7  you're making millions! I doubt you're "oppressed." Show respect for your country and your flag or leave!  #ColinKaepernick   #USA
0;@Kaepernick7  Can't we all just get along! It's your right to protest in your own way. Might I suggest doing push up instead of sitting. J/K
0;@Kaepernick7  BEWARE OF OPPORTUNISTIC FRAUDS LIKE UMAR JOHNSON, TARIQ NASHEED, BROTHER POLIGHT, BOYCE WATKINS, ZAZA ALI etc They're cons.
0;@Kaepernick7  We gotta make a change. In Arkansas we have the KKK capital in Harrison, AR look it up.

1;@Kaepernick7  this country is why you have millions. It's a disgrace and embarrassment for you to follow these actions. There's a better way
1;@Kaepernick7  Maybe your real problem starts with the fact that you are half white half black, maybe? Can't handle being half white, perhaps?

1;@Kaepernick7  don't worry I'll still support you kaep... why wouldn't I support a qb who throws game winning INT's for my team  @RSherman_25

0;@Kaepernick7  I think what you are doing is awesome. History will look fondly on you for shaking shit up. Dont listen to the haters.
1;@Kaepernick7  you are the biggest problem with this country. You should be fired from your contract, and deported from our borders...POS
1;@Kaepernick7  you play in the  @NFL , aka NATIONAL Football League. The  @NFL  should refuse to sign your check for being oppressed by you.
1;@Kaepernick7  that flag also represents the brave men and women who have died protecting it. Have fun losing you're job to Blaine Gabbert
1;@Kaepernick7  Not standing to show focus on "White Supremacy". Yeah, cause I make as much as you do & Went to college for free.  Retire. Now.
1;@kaepernick7 .....I agree with message but the delivery and the person behind it both need street cred. You have neither.  #salutetheflag
0;@Kaepernick7  Thanks for "your stand". You made me a 49ers fan. I'm white. Wish I could sit with you. Don't let the dummies get you down.
0;@Kaepernick7 , I SALUTE you in taking a stand. I hope more people and athletes follow....Continue to hold your head up high  #ColinKapernik

1;@Kaepernick7  you make $19 million per year and you can't stand up for your country's flag because you're "oppressed."
1;@Kaepernick7  should leave America
0;@Kaepernick7  As the father of "mixed" children and someone who detests nationalism, I really admire your stand! Been a fan since Nevada!
1;@Kaepernick7   You are only disrespecting those that sacrificed for your right to be one if the top3 D BAGS OF ALL TIME

1;@Kaepernick7  hey police will train you!! That way you can be part of the solution instead of part of the problem or are you scared???
1;@Kaepernick7  wasn't protesting anything. He was simply assuming his game spot for the season.
0;@Kaepernick7  black, white, asian, mexican all died for the flag they are called soldiers please think about that
0;@Kaepernick7  dares to be free in the "home of the free." Daring to be free is declaring our humanity w our actions.  #IamSittingwithColin
0;@Kaepernick7  From a swedish 49er and anti-rascist: Keep your head up and walk tall. You made a brave statement use the ball to silence hate

0;@Kaepernick7  just want to say thank you for standing up for what you believe in, regardless of the possible backlash that comes with it!
0;@Kaepernick7  We've become a society that has turned its back on true freedom, all in the same of safety.  That's unacceptable.
0;@Kaepernick7  continue to stand for what's right. A flag that wasn't meant for us to salute shouldn't be the measure of patriotism
1;@Kaepernick7  how bout you really stand up and put some of that money you are "oppressed" with into some poor communities.
0;@Kaepernick7  did not diss the ones who fought for it, but for the bigotry that stands behind it!!!
0;@Kaepernick7  did the right thing... they'd rather watch blacks smash each other on the field, not stand up 4 what's right!
1;@Kaepernick7  are you serious? You are a joke and waste of air. Respect the flag that allows you the millions you make or get the hell out!!

1;@Kaepernick7  You don't stand for a country's national anthem that pays you millions to play a game...you must not know what selfish means
1;@Kaepernick7  620,000 Americans died in Civil War to get you out of the cotton fields so you can be rich and privileged. Show that disrespect
1;@Kaepernick7  If you hate the USA so much, then go live among your own in africa. You can take a cow piss shower with your tribe

1;@Kaepernick7  l am no longer a fan of yours.  I fought for this country and flag and lost great friends defending your stupidity.
1;@Kaepernick7  even Usain Bolt had respect enough to stop an interview and turn and respect the American national anthem.
0;@Kaepernick7  is ballsy 4 sitting down & speaking up! Has endorsements & etc 2 lose. He's putting "skin" n the game!! pic.twitter.com/dNu9ia36j1
0;@Kaepernick7  respect the real. Salute brother.
1;@Kaepernick7  not standing for the American Anthem, yet you converted to Islam which oppress Christians and non Muslims. You are a hypocrite!
0;@Kaepernick7  keep standing up for justice man. I respect you as a football player now I have a new level of respect for you as a man   .
1;@Kaepernick7  U coward. Cops are given "paid leave" 4 killing CRIMINALS- u hate because you're Muslim, not only because you're black.  #liar
1;@Kaepernick7  is right. Black people don't owe allegiance to a country that doesn't align with them. Have you not been paying attention?
1;@Kaepernick7  or, even better: go find a country where black athletes are worshipped like they are here. Go to the CFL. Go to Europe.
1;@Kaepernick7    #Kaepernick  enjoys spitting in the face of the Veterans who fought for his right to be stupid!!!@LawrenceBJones3  @dbongino
0;@Kaepernick7  Why don't you donate a weeks's salary to help inner city youth in Milwaukee? That would be a statement.
0;@Kaepernick7  Big respect from the UK.  I have grown up here, but am half African-American.  I wouldn't stand up for either anthem at the mo.
1;@Kaepernick7  about to get released.  Than he's gonna get blacklisted in the NFL. Smart move kap.
0;@Kaepernick7  proud of you my brother. Only wish more of our Black Athletes would take a stand. But there was only one ALI, an only one Colin
0;@Kaepernick7  On a daily basis  I conquer institutionalized racism & racism in general. I understand where you are coming from I get it.
0;@Kaepernick7  i'm a french white dude, and i'm sitting next to you, in your fight, Colin. Black lives matter, every life does.
0;@Kaepernick7  you have the platform to make a positive impact on these social inequalities. Be great, be positive and make a difference.
0;@Kaepernick7  remember that all these haters would have bashed Ali for speaking out. Your protest puts you in the company of the  #GOAT
0;@Kaepernick7  thank u 4 your courage & voice. Once again, America's general response further proves the importance of  #blacklivesmatter   .
1;@Kaepernick7  you're pathetic
0;@Kaepernick7  that wasn't the time to do that...  #alllivesmatters
1;@Kaepernick7  now to compare to 2814 wt murders 2,023, or 72% by wts 409, or 15% by blks 93, or 3% by his. Now who are the racist? The blks
1;@Kaepernick7  men and women who have fought for our freedom and yours so you get to ride the bench for the rest of your career and get paid
0;@Kaepernick7  But do estimate the ignorance of a has been who simply retweets and retweets. Must not be capable of writing/forming a sentence
1;@Kaepernick7  can't make a statement with a football, he resorts to disrespectful behavior to draw attention to himself.  #ColinKaepernick
1;@Kaepernick7  has this victim hood mentality draped around his neck. 71% of black children are in families headed by a single parent.  #Hello ?
1;@kaepernick7   I'm not saying you care but I have no respect for u and I hope those dline men that stand for the anthem feast on you @JJWatt
1;@Kaepernick7  Cant even stand up for the national anthem. You really do belong on the bench.

0;@Kaepernick7  I am a veteran of the military and I also do not stand for the anthem..  we are not free, let's not blindly believe we are.
0;@Kaepernick7  America isn't racist. Some Americans are racist. As have been residents of every society and country in world history.
0;@Kaepernick7  People of every color, religion, sexual orientation have died defending that flag. I served in Iraq for all not some.
0;@Kaepernick7  The same country that gave you the chance to make millions playing a game still has people dying fighting for its flag.  #USA
1;@Kaepernick7  if u beleive in what u are protesting so much, u should give up your salary and position. Give up your not so suppressed spot.
0;@Kaepernick7  The hatred spewing is a miniscule example of the hatred you are protesting, which is why they are spewing. What's not to get???
0;@Kaepernick7  I am a veteran and I love the stand you made I understand all too well about fighting for a country that doesn't fight for me
0;@Kaepernick7  dude I applaud your stance but wish that you would change your mind. It's not worth the hatred you're gonna receive.
0;@Kaepernick7  I'm a Pats fan, so obviously no time for the 49ers, but I'm sorry everyone's going in on u. They think we live in North Korea.
1;@Kaepernick7  but whatever I'm sure you feel SO oppressed as a black quarterback making $19,000,000
1;@Kaepernick7  straight piece of shit. Bounce then
1;@Kaepernick7  your a coward go to a different country fuck boy.
1;@Kaepernick7   staying in our our country is privileged. You are required to stand for national anthem you don't like it leave.
0;@Kaepernick7  should publish a list of songs in his iTunes library to see what artists & lyrics he voluntarily listens to & supports.
0;@Kaepernick7  But they're still baffled by the need for a  #BlackLivesMatter    movement.
1;@Kaepernick7  do you really have 5 rooms in your house devoted to your shoes? You should, IDK, check yourself about being oppressed.
0;@Kaepernick7  The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution the most important part of the U.S. Constitution guarantees freedoms.

1;@Kaepernick7  your going to get cut for a little attention. I hope you Enjoy it while it lasts.

1;@Kaepernick7  if you want to see true injustice and TRUE police brutality travel to Russia where cops will rob you
0;@Kaepernick7  You have the right to sit through the anthem.. Just sad that it is a kick in the teeth to our soldiers giving their lives.
1;@Kaepernick7  hey just go ahead and stay seated for the rest of the season so the 49ers have a better chance to win lmao

0;@Kaepernick7  white or black, if a cop stops you, do as your told. Nothing good comes from cop hating or thinking there all bad
0;@Kaepernick7  hopefully your stance will make these other"all about the money"athletes speak up not hide behind endorsements and stupidity

1;@Kaepernick7  if your going to "stand up" for something then stand up for something! Sitting down during the National Anthem really?! No.
1;@Kaepernick7  It's a shame u show no respect for the men/women that have served to give u the freedom u have. Ppl like u make the gap bigger.

1;@Kaepernick7  seemed confused last night so I'll hep help him out. You sit on the bench DURING the game not before.
0;@Kaepernick7  You have people standing with you!
1;@Kaepernick7  Obama is in charge of the country for 8 years why don't you blame him ? You're  so uninformed
1;@Kaepernick7  your reasons for not standing during the National Anthem are inexcusable.  Pretty pathetic in my book you punk.
1;@Kaepernick7   I bet you won't mind cashing that check from such a country.
1;@Kaepernick7  maybe stick to football as backup instead of talking. pic.twitter.com/d0IowP1SW8
0;@Kaepernick7  Respect for your decision to distinguish between patriotism and capitulation/control. Stay strong and Go Niners!
1;@Kaepernick7  &  @HillaryClinton  u should link up. You've both made millions off the country yet hate it.  #HillaryClinton   #politics
0;@Kaepernick7  I respect your protest. It is hard to honor a country that continually dishonors people who look like you.
0;@Kaepernick7  I respect you all the way. Thank you   for making the unpopular decision
1;@Kaepernick7  is the definition of glamor muscles. I know guys who do concrete work that would destroy him. His mind..iyiyi very dumb very.
0;@Kaepernick7  Way to go, Colin. Standing up (or not standing, as the case may be) for what you believe in is patriotic. Ignore the haters.
1;@Kaepernick7  stop retweeting & find something relevant 2 say or think yourself. Better yet go find a country 2 live where u can b happy.
0;@Kaepernick7  doesn't stand for the national anthem and the world goes crazy. I haven't stood once for it in 20 years and no one says a word.
0;@Kaepernick7  Im a veteran that love and respect the flag,but as a black man under that same flag some think Patriotism is the status quo.
0;@Kaepernick7  much love to you my brother - even though you're sitting I stand (support) with you
