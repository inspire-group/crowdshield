0;@Kaepernick7   #CapsOffToCap  Thank you for taking a stand that MANY more should. Wish your bros supported you!
1;@Kaepernick7  The reason why you have opportunity to play football is brave soldiers died for our country. And you sit on a bench? Yuck.

1;@Kaepernick7  Your such a horrible person your making millions of dollars because if that flag you wouldn't stand for. Such a loser.
1;@Kaepernick7  Leave you fool. Leave the USA if you refuse to recognize those who died for you. You arent doing anything anyway.

0;@Kaepernick7  Colin, the NFL Games is NOT the place to protest. People expect Pro Athletes to act like Pros, not a Protester. Sign up at BLM

0;@Kaepernick7  in not standing for their national anthem and the reaction created show how ridiculously jingoistic the US media is
1;@Kaepernick7  you're the biggest POS ever! I actually liked you at one time. 2 years you'll be out of the league

0;@Kaepernick7  I support you for taking a "Nonviolent" stand on what's been going on in our country.
1;@Kaepernick7  is a little bit confused on what the flag stands for.  Also, how many dead animals are living in his hair?  #colinscurls
0;@Kaepernick7  it's commendable to stand up for what you believe.  You just offended billions of all races in the manner in which you chose.
1;@Kaepernick7  Like I said u hurt ur cause & showed urself 2 b a divisive sheep. When u stand for nothing, u'll fall 4 anything.
1;@Kaepernick7  doesn't pull this this stunt if his play = his pay. He's a bust and a fraud and this a desperate last grasp for the spotlight.
1;@Kaepernick7  go to Canada then if your not going to stand for this flag. Remember the ones who died for it.  #ungrateful

0;@Kaepernick7  I truly respect your protest by not standing during the anthem. How can we stand and show pride for this country.
1;@Kaepernick7   Do you realize that your protest insults the men and women that defend your freedom? Find another way keep my flag out of it.
0;@Kaepernick7  You'll see I supported you in the past. You protest the country that gives you the right to protest? Not well played.

0;@Kaepernick7  And then I heard  @carmeloanthony  say "This is what it's all about" and I couldn't help but disagree.
1;@Kaepernick7  How oppressive is that $19 mil, Colin. I guess this Country never did anything for you except pay you too much to play a game.
1;@Kaepernick7  Maybe you should LEAVE IF AMERICA is so PREJUDICE and take  @ArianaGrande  with you and you both can lick donuts together#BLESSIT
1;@Kaepernick7  You are too oppressed with that money.  Maybe you can be white like me and make $8/Hour.  Then you wont be so oppressed.
